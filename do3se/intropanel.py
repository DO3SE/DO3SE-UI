DO<sub>3</sub>SE (Deposition of Ozone for Stomatal Exchange) is a dry deposition
model designed to estimate the total and stomatal deposition (or flux) of ozone
(O<sub>3</sub>) to selected European land-cover types and plant species.
DO<sub>3</sub>SE has been developed to estimate the risk of O<sub>3</sub> damage
to European vegetation and is capable of providing flux-modelling estimates
according to UNECE LRTAP (Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution) methodologies
for effects-based risk assessment.  An almost identical version of
DO<sub>3</sub>SE has been embedded in the EMEP photochemical model to provide
estimates of total O<sub>3</sub> deposition and O<sub>3</sub> risk providing an
opportunity to formulate effects-based O<sub>3 precursor emission
reduction strategies for Europe.

<p>
DO<sub>3</sub>SE assumes that the key resistances to O<sub>3</sub> deposition
from an O<sub>3</sub> concentration (C<sub>O3</sub>) at some reference height in
the atmosphere to the ground surface are: the aerodynamic resistance
(R<sub>a</sub>), the quasi-laminar sub-layer resistance (R<sub>b</sub>) above
the canopy, and the surface resistance (R<sub>sur</sub>).  R<sub>sur</sub>
comprises two resistance paths in series; the stomatal and non-stomatal
resistance.  The latter represents within canopy aerodynamic resistance
(R<sub>inc</sub>) and subsequent soil resistance to decomposition at the soil
surface (R<sub>soil</sub>) which encompasses features such as leaf litter and
ground vegetation under forest canopies; as well as resistance to adsorption to
the external plant parts (R<sub>ext</sub>) including cuticle, bark etc.  The
stomatal resistance term (R<sub>sto</sub>) determines the resistance to
O3 uptake by the vegetation and hence is relevant for risk assessment
since it is via the stomates that O<sub>3</sub> enters and causes damage to
vegetation.
</p>

<p>
This interfaced version of the model (DO3SE_INTv1.0) is provided for users to
estimate total and stomatal O3 flux on a site-specific basis
according to local meteorological and O3 concentration data.
Default parameterisation is provided for certain cover-types and species though
users have the option of using their own local parameterisation.  The model
provides estimates of key deposition parameters including: total deposition
(F<sub>tot</sub>), deposition velocity (V<sub>g</sub>), stomatal conductance
(g<sub>sto</sub>) and accumulated leaf-level stomtal flux above a threshold
(AFstY).

Full referenced documentation of the DO<sub>3</sub>SE model and a DO3SE_INTv1.0
user manual is provided with this model interface.
