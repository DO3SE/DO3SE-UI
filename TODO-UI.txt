Because of ``python -m foo``, can move launching into do3se/__init__.py?

``blah`` and ``blah_map`` should no longer be necessary with OrderedDict - change them to be just ``blah`` which is the map!

Update things which aren't already using ``to_dicts()`` and ``dicts_to_map()``.

Things which aren't basic fields need to become subclasses of FieldGroup.

Several bugs no longer apply with new UI.

Applying parameterisations is as simple as using ``set_values()`` on the field collection!
