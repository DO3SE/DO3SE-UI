``blah`` and ``blah_map`` should no longer be necessary with OrderedDict - change them to be just ``blah`` which is the map!

Update things which aren't already using ``to_dicts()`` and ``dicts_to_map()``.

Several bugs no longer apply with new UI.

Application object should keep track of open windows, have method for closing all windows

MASSIVE BUG: widgets not drawing when new windows are created!
