==================
DOSE Model UI TODO
==================

Tasks
=====
Convert F code line endings to DOS and re-send source code
-   Put this in the Makefile (have rules for making various packages)

Site and Vegetation parameter editing
-   Validation
    -   Cascading range check on fphen_*

Input fields validation
-   Check for valid/invalid combinations of fields

Output fields validation
-   Check that some are set!

Dataset error raising/handling
-   Raise exceptions on failing to load a data file
    -   Convert the exceptions into notifying the user and aborting the process

Calculate results in a thread
-   Some form of UI notification of this?  Or allow concurrency?


Concepts
========
Workflow
--------
Ability to save/load entire results sets for later analysis
-   Reduce the need to re-calculate the same data again, or try and remember 
    settings, etc.
-   "Project file"

Load parameters from a result set back into the main window
-   "I had some good settings around here somewhere..."

Re-run same input data with new parameters from a result set
-   For those tweak-run-tweak-run-tweak-run moments...

Memory
------
Enforce some kind of limitation on number of datasets open?
-   Bad idea, let the user cope!
-   Instead, document how much memory is used, and warn the user


Ideas from wxPython demo...
---------------------------
AUI_MDI?  Or AUI_Notebook?
ComboCtrl for presetchooser
Replace notebook(s) with toolbooks?
