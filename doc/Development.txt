Development
===========

Building the F program
----------------------
Open a Cygwin bash shell and navigate to the directory containing the project 
files.  To build the program, type `make`.  The program will appear as "dose" 
in the current directory.  To run it, type `./dose`.


Modifying the input and output
------------------------------
The file "dose.f90" in the "F" directory contains all the definitions that 
control the reading of the input file and writing of the output file, 
derivation of inputs, and which methods to use for interchangeable calculations.

The file is documented in its comments, so it should be self-explanatory how to
modify this file.  Once changes have been made, run `make` again to rebuild the
program.
