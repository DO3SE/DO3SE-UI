Development (Windows)
===========

Setting up the environment for F
--------------------------------

=== Cygwin ===

Cygwin is a collection of Unix-like utilities for Windows.

Download the Cygwin "setup.exe" from http://www.cygwin.com.  Run the 
installer, telling it to install in "C:\cygwin" and making sure to 
select the following packages:

 + Archive -> unzip
 + Devel -> make

*NOTE:* Do *not* install the Cygwin version of Python or MinGW - these 
        will get used instead of the native Windows versions if installed.

Cygwin will probably sit there for about 20 minutes (for on a reasonably fast 
internet connection) downloading packages, and then installing them.

Once Cygwin is installed, open the "System Properties" dialog ("System" in 
Control Panel), go to the "Advanced" tab, and click "Environment Variables".  
In this new dialog, if there is already an item called "PATH" in the "User
variables" section, select it and click "Edit", otherwise click "New" and use
"PATH" as the variable name.  The value for this variable is a list of 
directory paths to search for executable programs, separated by ";".  Add the
path "C:\cygwin\bin" to this list and click "OK".  This step is not entirely
necessary if only working with the Fortran model and not needing to update the
user interface, but is useful anyway.

=== F Compiler ===

Browse to ftp://ftp.swcp.com/pub/walt/F and download FortranTools_windows_F.zip
to your Cygwin home directory (C:\cygwin\home\username).  Open a Cygwin 
terminal, unzip the FortranTools file and go into the new directory:

    unzip FortranTools_windows_F.zip
    cd FortranTools

There seems to be a problem with the installation script in the Windows version
of FortranTools, but its possible to fix by running the following:

    sed "s/\r//g" install_fortrantools > install_fortrantools.fixed

Install FortranTools by running the following, answering "yes" when asked to 
confirm the installation directory:

    ./install_fortrantools.fixed


Setting up the environment for Python
-------------------------------------

=== Python ===

Browse to http://www.python.org/download/, download the Python Windows 
Installer and install it to its default location.  Open the "System Properties"
dialog, go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".  In this
dialog, edit the "PATH" user variable, adding the Python installation directory
to it (probably "C:\Python25").

=== Numerical Python (numpy) ===

This package is necessary for building the Python module from the F source 
code.

Browse to http://numpy.scipy.org/ and follow the download links - download the 
version ending in "win32-py2.5.exe".  Run the installer and let it install into
the Python directory.

=== MinGW ===

Browse to http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ , follow the link to the 
downloads page, and download the latest version of the Automated MinGW 
Installer.  Run it, installing to "C:\MinGW" (a minimal install is fine).

=== G95 Fortran ===

From http://ftp.g95.org download the "Self-extracting Windows x86" version, 
and install it to "C:\MinGW".  Answer "Yes" when asked about installing into
"C:\MinGW" and setting the PATH and LIBRARY_PATH variables.
