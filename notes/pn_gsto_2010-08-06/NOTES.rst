Hourly inputs are PAR, windspeed at leaf surface, CO2 concentration (ambient), relative humidity  
(ambient), air temperature (ambient) and leaf temperature.

  + PAR, windspeed and air temperature already supplied.
  + Relative humidity can be calculated from air temperature and VPD?
  + Some method for deriving T_leaf?
  + Some method for deriving CO2 concentration?
